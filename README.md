# Example code for husky and lint-staged with pre-commit and pre-push

> Note: If you are using VS Code, be sure to update your settings to log the pre-push hook results. Otherwise it won't show up at all. You can do this by opening up settings, and adding "push" (without quotes) to "Git: Commands To Log".
